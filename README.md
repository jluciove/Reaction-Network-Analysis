# Reaction Network Analysis

Python code developed to analyze results from a legacy kinetic modeling tool. The code parses information from a reaction network and property files to analyze the model. 

Important Files:
  * reaction_network_analysis.py - Main file
  * models.py - Parse data from files and transfer to class data structure
  * rxns.py - Parse reaction info and store in class
